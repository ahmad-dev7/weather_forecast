Welcome to my app development internship at Bharat-Intern! In this internship, I've developed two Flutter applications: a to-do list app and a weather forecast app.

## To-Do List App

The to-do list app helps users keep track of their tasks efficiently. Here are some key features:

- **Task Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Due Date and Time**: Users can set due dates and times for their tasks.
- **Title and Description**: Users can add titles and descriptions to their tasks.
- **Local Data Storage**: The app uses Hive as local data storage to persist tasks across sessions.

## Weather Forecast App

The weather forecast app provides real-time weather information for users. Here are some key features:

- **Real-Time Weather**: The app displays real-time weather data based on the user's current location.
- **Location Switching**: Users can switch locations to view weather forecasts for different places.
- **API Integration**: The app uses an API to fetch weather data and display it to the user.
